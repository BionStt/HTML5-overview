title:  "Adding Individual Specification History"

A tiny bit of Jekyll magic was all it took to add individual specification history lists to specification pages. Each specification page now lists all the updates that mentioned this particular specification. All of this is done by using the post's tags (a surprisingly badly documented aspect of Jekyll) and listing all posts using that tag on each specification's page.
