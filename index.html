HTML5 is a growing and constantly evolving collection of browser technologies that allow Web apps to become more sophisticated, and replicate more of the functionality that traditionally has been limited to native apps.

This site tracks the developing HTML5 landscape and provides an overview of the current state. It is updated regularly and managed [openly on GitHub](https://github.com/dret/HTML5-overview).
