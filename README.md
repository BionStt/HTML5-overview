# HTML5 Overview

HTML5 is more a movement (or maybe it's more appropriate to call it a *brand*) than it is a technology. It says "more power to the browser" but mostly means "more power to the browser *as a programming platform*". Given this focus of HTML5, it is surprisingly hard to find a good place where all the APIs under development are listed. This collection is an attempt to have all that information in one place. The current status captured here lists 154 specifications. However, since the HTML5 landscape is changing fairly quickly, it is likely that some information on this page is outdated. If that is the case, please submit an issue or create a pull request (please keep in mind that the [MD](README.md) is generated from [XML](html5.xml) via [XSLT](XSLT/xml2md.xsl)). Thanks!

Most HTML5 specifications are [W3C](http://www.w3.org/ "World Wide Web Consortium") [TR track documents](http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#rec-advance "W3C Technical Reports"), and of those this page lists 104 current specifications (grouped by status), while [a separate page lists 39 specifications where development has stopped](MD/abandoned.md) (143 W3C documents overall). HTML5 specifications are also developed in other places, and this page lists 10 of these other specifications.

Here's a list of all current HTML5 specs (generated from [XML](html5.xml)), first W3C TR (grouped by status), and then others (except for the [separately listed abandoned specs](MD/abandoned.md)):

## W3C TR Specifications (104 Specs)

### Recommendations (23 Specs)

* [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria "Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about widgets, structures, and behaviors, in order to allow assistive technologies to convey appropriate information to persons with disabilities. This specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. These semantics are designed to allow an author to properly convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies in document-level markup.")
* [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors "This document defines a mechanism to enable client-side cross-origin requests. Specifications that enable an API to make cross-origin requests to resources can use the algorithms defined by this specification. If such an API is used on http://example.org resources, a resource on http://hello-world.example can opt in using the mechanism described by this specification (e.g., specifying Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.org as response header), which would allow that resource to be fetched cross-origin from http://example.org.")
* [Geolocation API Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API "This specification defines an API that provides scripted access to geographical location information associated with the hosting device.")
* [HTML Canvas 2D Context](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext "This specification defines the 2D Context for the HTML canvas element. The 2D Context provides objects, methods, and properties to draw and manipulate graphics on a canvas drawing surface.")

By allowing a hyperlink inside another one, this document explicitly redefines the HTML concept of hyperlink in a limited set of circumstances.")
* [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5 "This specification defines the 5th major revision of the core language of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version, new features are introduced to help Web application authors, new elements are introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and special attention has been given to defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability.")
* [HTML5 Web Messaging](http://www.w3.org/TR/webmessaging "This specification defines two mechanism for communicating between browsing contexts in HTML documents.")
* [High Resolution Time](http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time "This specification defines a JavaScript interface that provides the current time in sub-millisecond resolution and such that it is not subject to system clock skew or adjustments.")
* [Indexed Database API](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB "This document defines APIs for a database of records holding simple values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key and some value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records it stores. An application developer directly uses an API to locate records either by their key or by using an index. A query language can be layered on this API. An indexed database can be implemented using a persistent B-tree data structure.")
* [Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) Version 3.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3 " This specification defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or MathML. MathML is a markup language for describing mathematical notation and capturing both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for text. This specification of the markup language MathML is intended primarily for a readership consisting of those who will be developing or implementing renderers or editors using it, or software that will communicate using MathML as a protocol for input or output. It is not a User's Guide but rather a reference document. MathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and mathematical content. About thirty-eight of the MathML tags describe abstract notational structures, while another about one hundred and seventy provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended meaning of an expression. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue of special characters used for mathematics, their handling in MathML, their presence in Unicode, and their relation to fonts. While MathML is human-readable, authors typically will use equation editors, conversion programs, and other specialized software tools to generate MathML. Several versions of such MathML tools exist, both freely available software and commercial products, and more are under development.")

The API is designed such that it can be extended to work with other push notification schemes such as Push SMS.")
* [Touch Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events "The Touch Events specification defines a set of low-level events that represent one or more points of contact with a touch-sensitive surface, and changes of those points with respect to the surface and any DOM elements displayed upon it (e.g. for touch screens) or associated with it (e.g. for drawing tablets without displays). It also addresses pen-tablet devices, such as drawing tablets, with consideration toward stylus capabilities.")
* [User Timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/user-timing "This specification defines an interface to help web developers measure the performance of their applications by giving them access to high precision timestamps.")
* [Vibration API](http://www.w3.org/TR/vibration "This specification defines an API that provides access to the vibration mechanism of the hosting device. Vibration is a form of tactile feedback.")

* [Confinement with Origin Web Labels](http://www.w3.org/TR/cowl "This specification defines an API for specifying privacy and integrity policies on data, in the form of origin labels, and a mechanism for confining code according to such policies. This allows Web application authors and server operators to share data with untrusted—buggy but not malicious—code (e.g., in a mashup scenario) yet impose restrictions on how the code can share the data further.")
* [Content Security Policy Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3 "This document defines a mechanism by which web developers can control the resources which a particular page can fetch or execute, as well as a number of security-relevant policy decisions.")
* [Cooperative Scheduling of Background Tasks](http://www.w3.org/TR/requestidlecallback "This document defines an API that web page authors can use to cooperatively schedule background tasks such that they do not introduce delays to other high priority tasks that share the same event loop, such as input processing, animations and frame compositing. The user agent is in a better position to determine when background tasks can be run without introducing user-perceptible delays or jank in animations and input response, based on its knowledge of currently scheduled tasks, vsync deadlines, user-interaction and so on. Using this API should therefore result in more appropriate scheduling of background tasks during times when the browser would otherwise be idle.")
* [Credential Management Level 1](http://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1 "This specification describes an imperative API enabling a website to request a user's credentials from a user agent, and to help the user agent correctly store user credentials for future use.")

* [Encoding](http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding "While encodings have been defined to some extent, implementations have not always implemented them in the same way, have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealing with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. This specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations can converge.")
* [Encrypted Media Extensions](http://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media "This proposal extends HTMLMediaElement providing APIs to control playback of protected content. The API supports use cases ranging from simple clear key decryption to high value video (given an appropriate user agent implementation). License/key exchange is controlled by the application, facilitating the development of robust playback applications supporting a range of content decryption and protection technologies. This specification does not define a content protection or Digital Rights Management system. Rather, it defines a common API that may be used to discover, select and interact with such systems as well as with simpler content encryption systems. Implementation of Digital Rights Management is not required for compliance with this specification: only the simple clear key system is required to be implemented as a common baseline. The common API supports a simple set of content encryption capabilities, leaving application functions such as authentication and authorization to page authors. This is achieved by requiring content protection system-specific messaging to be mediated by the page rather than assuming out-of-band communication between the encryption system and a license or other server.")
* [File API](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI "This specification provides an API for representing file objects in web applications, as well as programmatically selecting them and accessing their data.")

* [Frame Timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/frame-timing "This specification defines an interface for web applications to access runtime performance information of the browser event loop, enabling them to identify and fix issues that cause delayed rendering, processing of input, and other critical work necessary to deliver a smooth and responsive user experience.")
* [Gamepad](http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad "The Gamepad specification defines a low-level interface that represents gamepad devices.")
* [Generic Sensor API](http://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor "This specification defines a framework for exposing sensor data to the Open Web Platform in a consistent way. It does so by defining a blueprint for writing specifications of concrete sensors along with an abstract Sensor interface that can be extended to accommodate different sensor types.")
* [Geofencing API](http://www.w3.org/TR/geofencing "This specification defines an API that lets webapps setup geographic boundaries around specific locations and then receive notifications when the hosting device enters or leaves those areas.") ([ED](https://w3c.github.io/geofencing-api/ "Editor's Draft"))
* [HTML 5.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/html51 "This specification defines the 5th major version, first minor revision of the core language of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version, new features continue to be introduced to help Web application authors, new elements continue to be introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and special attention continues to be given to defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability.")
* [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0 "HTML Accessibility API Mappings (HTML-AAM) defines how user agents map HTML 5.1 elements and attributes to platform accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs). It leverages and extends the Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 and the Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1 for use with the HTML 5.1 host language. Documenting these mappings promotes interoperable exposure of roles, states, properties, and events implemented by accessibility APIs and helps to ensure that this information appears in a manner consistent with author intent.")
* [HTML Imports](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-imports "HTML Imports are a way to include and reuse HTML documents in other HTML documents.")

* [Identifiers for WebRTC's Statistics API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtcstats "This document defines a set of JavaScript APIs that allow access to the statistical information about a PeerConnection.")
* [IndieUI: Events 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-events "IndieUI: Events 1.0 is an abstraction between physical, device-specific user interaction events and inferred user intent such as scrolling or changing values. This provides an intermediate layer between device- and modality-specific user interaction events, and the basic user interface functionality used by web applications. IndieUI: Events focuses on granular user interface interactions such as scrolling the view, canceling an action, changing the value of a user input widget, selecting a range, placing focus on an object, etc. Implementing platforms will combine modality-specific user input, user idiosyncratic heuristics to determine the specific corresponding Indie UI event, and send that to the web application in addition to the modality-specific input such as mouse or keyboard events, should applications wish to process it.")
* [IndieUI: User Context 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-context "IndieUI: User Context defines a set of preferences that users can choose to expose to web applications, and an API for user agents to access the preferences and listen for changes. User can set preferences for features such as screen and font size, color, and typographical preferences. Users with disabilities can provide information about assistive technologies in use, indicate that the display is in an accessibility mode, and indicate whether and what kind of subtitles and audio descriptions they need. Web applications can use this information to optimize the presentation without a requirement to target a specific device, operating system, or locale. While customizations based on these properties benefit users, the information could also be used to make assumptions about users or compromise anonymity. Therefore, the specification includes user agent requirements to allow users to opt out and choose not to expose information on a category basis to preserve privacy.")
* [Input Method Editor API](http://www.w3.org/TR/ime-api "This specification defines an ”IME API” that provides Web applications with scripted access to an IME (input-method editor) associated with a hosting user agent. This IME API includes: an InputMethodContext interface, which provides methods to retrieve detailed data from an in-progress IME composition; and a Composition dictionary, which represents read-only attributes about the current composition, such as the actual text and its style. This API is designed to be used in conjunction with DOM events.")
* [Manifest for Web Application](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest "This specification defines a JSON-based manifest that provides developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with a web application. This includes, but is not limited to, the web application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL to open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows developers to declare a default orientation for their web application, as well as providing the ability to set the display mode for the application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally, the manifest allows a developer to ”scope” a web application to a URL. This restricts the URLs to which the application can be navigated and provides a means to ”deep link” into a web application from other applications. Using this metadata, user agents can provide developers with means to create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native application. In addition, this specification defines the manifest link type, which provides a declarative means for a document to be associated with a manifest.")
* [Media Capture Depth Stream Extensions](http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-depth "This specification extends the Media Capture and Streams specification to allow a depth-only stream or combined depth+video stream to be requested from the web platform using APIs familiar to web authors.")

* [Network Error Logging](http://www.w3.org/TR/network-error-logging "This document defines a mechanism that enables developers to declare a network error reporting policy for a web application. A user agent can use this policy to report encountered network errors that prevented it from successfully fetching requested resources.")
* [Network Service Discovery](http://www.w3.org/TR/discovery-api "This specification defines a mechanism for an HTML document to discover and subsequently communicate with HTTP-based services advertised via common discovery protocols within the current network.")

* [Push API](http://www.w3.org/TR/push-api "The Push API enables sending of a push message to a webapp via a push service. An application server can send a push message at any time, even when a webapp or user agent is inactive. The push service ensures reliable and efficient delivery to the user agent. Push messages are delivered to a Service Worker that runs in the origin of the webapp, which can use the information in the message to update local state or display a notification to the user. This specification is designed for use with the web push protocol, which describes how an application server or user agent interacts with a push service.")
* [Quota Management API](http://www.w3.org/TR/quota-api "This specification defines an API to manage usage and availability of local storage resources, and defines a means by which a user agent (UA) may grant Web applications permission to use more local space, temporarily or persistently, via various different storage APIs.")
* [Referrer Policy](http://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy "This document describes how an author can set a referrer policy for documents they create, and the impact of such a policy on the referer HTTP header for outgoing requests and navigations.")
* [Resource Hints](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints "This specification defines the dns-prefetch, preconnect, prefetch, and prerender relationships of the HTML Link Element (<link>). These primitives enable the developer, and the server generating or delivering the resources, to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, and which resources it should fetch and preprocess to improve page performance.")

* [Selection API](http://www.w3.org/TR/selection-api "This document is a preliminary draft of a specification for the Selection API and selection related functionality. It replaces a couple of old sections of the HTML specification, the selection part of the old DOM Range specification. This document defines APIs for selection, which allows users and authors to select a portion of a document or specify a point of interest for copy, paste, and other editing operations.")
* [Server Timing](http://www.w3.org/TR/server-timing "This specification introduces Server Timing, which enables the server to communicate performance metrics about the request-response cycle to the user agent, and a JavaScript interface to enable applications to collect, process, and act on these metrics to optimize application delivery.")
* [Service Workers](http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers "This specification describes a method that enables applications to take advantage of persistent background processing, including hooks to enable bootstrapping of web applications while offline. The core of this system is an event-driven Web Worker, which responds to events dispatched from documents and other sources. A system for managing installation, versions, and upgrades is provided. The Service Worker is a generic entry point for event-driven background processing in the Web Platform that is extensible by other specifications.")

* [Web Animations](http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations "This specification defines a model for synchronization and timing of changes to the presentation of a Web page. This specification also defines an application programming interface for interacting with this model and it is expected that further specifications will define declarative means for exposing these features.")
* [Web Audio API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio "This specification describes a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The primary paradigm is of an audio routing graph, where a number of AudioNode objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering. The actual processing will primarily take place in the underlying implementation (typically optimized Assembly/C/C++ code), but direct JavaScript processing and synthesis is also supported. This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements on the web platform, notably: XMLHttpRequest (using the responseType and response attributes). For games and interactive applications, it is anticipated to be used with the canvas 2D and WebGL 3D graphics APIs.")
* [Web MIDI API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi " Some user agents have connected music devices, such as synthesizers, keyboard and other controllers, and drum machines. The widely adopted Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) protocol enables electronic musical instruments, controllers and computers to communicate and synchronize with each other. MIDI does not transmit audio signals: instead, it sends event messages about musical notes, controller signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato and panning, cues and clock signals to set the tempo, and system-specific MIDI communications (e.g. to remotely store synthesizer-specific patch data). This same protocol has become a standard for non-musical uses, such as show control, lighting and special effects control. This specification defines an API supporting the MIDI protocol, enabling web applications to enumerate and select MIDI input and output devices on the client system and send and receive MIDI messages. It is intended to enable non-music MIDI applications as well as music ones, by providing low-level access to the MIDI devices available on the users' systems. At the same time, the Web MIDI API is not intended to become a semantic controller platform; it is designed to expose the mechanics of MIDI input and output interfaces, and the practical aspects of sending and receiving MIDI messages, without identifying what those actions might mean semantically. To some users, ”MIDI” has become synonymous with Standard MIDI Files and General MIDI. That is not the intent of this API; the use case of simply playing back a .SMF file is not within the purview of this specification (it could be considered a different format to be supported by the HTML5 <audio> element, for example). The Web MIDI API is intended to enable direct access to devices that respond to MIDI - external synthesizers or lighting systems, for example, or even the software synthesizers that are built in to many common operating systems. The Web MIDI API is also explicitly designed to enable a new class of applications on the web that can respond to MIDI controller inputs - using external hardware controllers with physical buttons, knobs and sliders (as well as musical controllers like keyboard, guitar or wind instrument controllers) to control web applications. The Web MIDI API is also expected to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements of the web platform, notably the Web Audio API and High-Resolution Time. This API is also intended to be familiar to users of MIDI APIs on other systems, such as Apple's CoreMIDI and Microsoft's Windows MIDI API.")
* [Web Workers](http://www.w3.org/TR/workers "This specification defines an API that allows Web application authors to spawn background workers running scripts in parallel to their main page. This allows for thread-like operation with message-passing as the coordination mechanism.")
* [WebDriver](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver "This specification defines the WebDriver API, a platform-and language-neutral interface that allows programs or scripts to introspect into, and control the behaviour of, a web browser. The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests that automate a browser from a separate controlling process, but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a browser. The WebDriver API is defined by a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page, and to control the behaviour of the containing browser. This specification also includes a non-normative reference useful for browser vendors.")
* [WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers](http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc "This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media to be sent over the network to another browser or device implementing the appropriate set of real-time protocols, and media to be received from another browser or device. This specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed by the IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local media devices developed by the Media Capture Task Force.")
* [WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks Format](http://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1 "This specification defines WebVTT, the Web Video Text Tracks format. Its main use is for marking up external text track resources in connection with the HTML <track> element. WebVTT files provide captions or subtitles for video content, and also text video descriptions, chapters for content navigation, and more generally any form of metadata that is time-aligned with audio or video content.")
* [XMLHttpRequest](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest "The XMLHttpRequest specification defines an API that provides scripted client functionality for transferring data between a client and a server.")

## Non-W3C Specifications (10 Specs)

* [Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/ "The Fetch standard defines requests, responses, and the process that binds them; fetching.")
* [FileSystem API](http://w3c.github.io/filesystem-api/ "The FileSystem API defines functionality on a local sandboxed file system within the same origin of the Web Application that created it. It exposes standard file system operations to Web Applications, such as creation of files and directories, and reading and writing of them (from and to disk), including other programmatic manipulation of files and directories.")
* [Fullscreen API](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/ "Fullscreen defines the fullscreen API for the web platform.")
* [Notifications API](https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/ "This standard defines an API to display notifications to the end user, typically outside the top-level browsing context's viewport. It is designed to be compatible with existing notification systems, while remaining platform-independent.")
* [Storage](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/ "The Storage Standard defines an API for persistent storage and quota estimates, as well as the platform storage architecture.")
* [Web Bluetooth](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/ "This document describes an API to discover and communicate with devices over the Bluetooth 4 wireless standard using the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT).")
* [Web NFC API](http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/ "Near Field Communication (NFC) enables wireless communication between two devices at close proximity, usually less than a few centimeters. NFC is an international standard (ISO/IEC 18092) defining an interface and protocol for simple wireless interconnection of closely coupled devices operating at 13.56 MHz. This specification defines an API to manage selected NFC use-cases from web pages, and to enable new use-cases based on NFC technology.")
* [Web Speech API Specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html "This specification defines a JavaScript API to enable web developers to incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into their web pages. It enables developers to use scripting to generate text-to-speech output and to use speech recognition as an input for forms, continuous dictation and control. The JavaScript API allows web pages to control activation and timing and to handle results and alternatives.")
* [WebGL 1.0](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/ "This specification describes an additional rendering context and support objects for the HTML 5 canvas element. This context allows rendering using an API that conforms closely to the OpenGL ES 2.0 API.")
* [WebGL 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/ "This is Version 2.0 of the WebGL Specification. This specification describes an additional rendering context and support objects for the HTML 5 canvas element. This context allows rendering using an API that conforms closely to the OpenGL ES 3.0 API. This document should be read as an extension to the WebGL 1.0 specification. It will only describe the differences from 1.0.")
