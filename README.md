HTML5 Overview
==============

An overview of all HTML5 standardization activities. For now, this content is also [published on my blog](http://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/html5-api-overview.html) by [transforming it to HTML](xml2html.xsl), but this may change over time.

HTML5 is more a movement (or maybe it's more appropriate to call it a *brand*) than it is a technology. it says "more power to the browser" and mostly means "more power to the browser *as a programming platform*". Given this focus of HTML5, it is surprisingly hard to find a good place where all the APIs under development are listed. This collection is an attempt to have all that information in one place. The current status captured on this page lists 84 current specifications and 21 specifications that were retired as notes (105 total). Since the HTML5 landscape is changing fairly quickly, it is likely that some information on this page is outdated. If that is the case, please submit an issue or create a pull request. Thanks!

I am currently working on making this page as complete as the blog page. As a starting point, here's a status-ordered list of all HTML5 specs covered in the [XML source for this page](html5.xml), containing a total of 105 specs (for a classification and abstracts, [please visit the blog for now](http://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/html5-api-overview.html) or [use the XML source](html5.xml)):

* [Timing Control for Script-Based Animations](http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing "This document defines an API web page authors can use to write script-based animations where the user agent is in control of limiting the update rate of the animation. The user agent is in a better position to determine the ideal animation rate based on whether the page is currently in a foreground or background tab, what the current load on the CPU is, and so on. Using this API should therefore result in more appropriate utilization of the CPU by the browser.")
* [Web Cryptography API](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI "This specification describes a JavaScript API for performing basic cryptographic operations in web applications, such as hashing, signature generation and verification, and encryption and decryption. Additionally, it describes an API for applications to generate and/or manage the keying material necessary to perform these operations. Uses for this API range from user or service authentication, document or code signing, and the confidentiality and integrity of communications.")

* [Encoding](http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding "While encodings have been defined to some extent, implementations have not always implemented them in the same way, have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealing with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. This specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations can converge.")
* [Encrypted Media Extensions](http://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media "This proposal extends HTMLMediaElement providing APIs to control playback of protected content. The API supports use cases ranging from simple clear key decryption to high value video (given an appropriate user agent implementation). License/key exchange is controlled by the application, facilitating the development of robust playback applications supporting a range of content decryption and protection technologies. This specification does not define a content protection or Digital Rights Management system. Rather, it defines a common API that may be used to discover, select and interact with such systems as well as with simpler content encryption systems. Implementation of Digital Rights Management is not required for compliance with this specification: only the simple clear key system is required to be implemented as a common baseline. The common API supports a simple set of content encryption capabilities, leaving application functions such as authentication and authorization to page authors. This is achieved by requiring content protection system-specific messaging to be mediated by the page rather than assuming out-of-band communication between the encryption system and a license or other server.")
* [File API](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI "This specification provides an API for representing file objects in web applications, as well as programmatically selecting them and accessing their data.")

* [Identifiers for WebRTC's Statistics API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtcstats "This document defines a set of JavaScript APIs that allow access to the statistical information about a PeerConnection.")
* [IndieUI: Events 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-events "IndieUI: Events 1.0 is an abstraction between physical, device-specific user interaction events and inferred user intent such as scrolling or changing values. This provides an intermediate layer between device- and modality-specific user interaction events, and the basic user interface functionality used by web applications. IndieUI: Events focuses on granular user interface interactions such as scrolling the view, canceling an action, changing the value of a user input widget, selecting a range, placing focus on an object, etc. Implementing platforms will combine modality-specific user input, user idiosyncratic heuristics to determine the specific corresponding Indie UI event, and send that to the web application in addition to the modality-specific input such as mouse or keyboard events, should applications wish to process it.")
* [IndieUI: User Context 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-context "IndieUI: User Context defines a set of preferences that users can choose to expose to web applications, and an API for user agents to access the preferences and listen for changes. User can set preferences for features such as screen and font size, color, and typographical preferences. Users with disabilities can provide information about assistive technologies in use, indicate that the display is in an accessibility mode, and indicate whether and what kind of subtitles and audio descriptions they need. Web applications can use this information to optimize the presentation without a requirement to target a specific device, operating system, or locale. While customizations based on these properties benefit users, the information could also be used to make assumptions about users or compromise anonymity. Therefore, the specification includes user agent requirements to allow users to opt out and choose not to expose information on a category basis to preserve privacy.")
* [Input Method Editor API](http://www.w3.org/TR/ime-api "This specification defines an ”IME API” that provides Web applications with scripted access to an IME (input-method editor) associated with a hosting user agent. This IME API includes: an InputMethodContext interface, which provides methods to retrieve detailed data from an in-progress IME composition; and a Composition dictionary, which represents read-only attributes about the current composition, such as the actual text and its style. This API is designed to be used in conjunction with DOM events.")
* [Manifest for Web Apps and Bookmarks](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest "This specification defines a manifest, which provides developers with a centralized place to put metadata about a web application. This includes, amongst other things, the ability to specify the name of the web application, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL at which the web application should open when it is launched by the user. With this metadata, user agents can provide, for example, enhanced bookmarking capabilities such as being able to add a web application to the homescreen of a device - as well as the various icons needed to effectively integrate with an OS's task switcher and system preferences. The specification also defines an API to enable bookmarking from within a document, as well as a means to check if an application is running in a special mode called ”standalone”. This specification also defines the manifest link type, which provides a declarative means for a web document to be associated with a manifest.")
* [Media Capture Depth Stream Extensions](http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-depth "This specification extends the Media Capture and Streams specification to allow a depth stream to be requested from the web platform using APIs familiar to web authors.")

* [Messaging API](http://www.w3.org/TR/messaging "This specification defines a System Level API which offers a simple interface to get access to mobile messaging services. A typical use case of the Messaging API is the implementation of a messaging client application that allows the user to send SMS and MMS messages as well as to access and manage the received SMS and MMS messages.")
* [Navigation Error Logging](http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-error-logging "This specification defines an interface to store and retrieve error data related to the previous navigations of a document.")
* [Navigation Timing 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing-2 "This specification defines a unified interface to store and retrieve high resolution performance metric data related to the navigation of a document.")
* [Network Service Discovery](http://www.w3.org/TR/discovery-api "This specification defines a mechanism for an HTML document to discover and subsequently communicate with HTTP-based services advertised via common discovery protocols within the current network.")
* [Pointer Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents "This document defines events and related interfaces for handling hardware agnostic pointer input from devices like a mouse, pen, or touchscreen. For compatibility with existing mouse-based content, this specification also describes a mapping to fire DOM3 Mouse Events for pointer device types other than mouse.")
* [Push API](http://www.w3.org/TR/push-api "This specification defines a ”Push API” that provides webapps with scripted access to server-sent notifications, for simplicity referred to here as push notifications, as delivered by push services. Push services are a way for application servers to send messages to webapps, whether or not the webapp is active in a browser window. Push notifications may be delivered via various methods, either via standardized protocols (e.g. Server-Sent Events, the GSM Short Message Service, SIP MESSAGE, or OMA Push), or via browser-specific methods. The specific method to be used by a webapp is either selected by the user through a push service extension, or by the browser. The Push API is defined to promote compatibility with any delivery method.")
* [Quota Management API](http://www.w3.org/TR/quota-api "This specification defines an API to manage usage and availability of local storage resources, and defines a means by which a user agent (UA) may grant Web applications permission to use more local space, temporarily or persistently, via various different storage APIs.")

* [Runtime and Security Model for Web Applications](http://www.w3.org/TR/runtime "This document specifies a runtime and security model for Web Applications. It describes how an application is defined through an application manifest, and how it can be installed, updated and packaged. It also specifies how such an application can be put into the background, be put back in the foreground or woken up. Finally, the document describes the security model for such applications. This includes the permission model and the different security rules that would apply.")
* [Screen Orientation API](http://www.w3.org/TR/screen-orientation "The Screen Orientation API provides the ability to read the screen orientation type and angle, to be informed when the screen orientation state changes, and be able to lock the screen orientation to a specific state.")
* [Selectors API Level 1](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api "The Selectors API specification defines methods for retrieving Element nodes from the DOM by matching against a group of selectors.")
* [Selectors API Level 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api2 "The Selectors API specification defines methods for retrieving element nodes from the DOM by matching against a group of selectors, and for testing if a given element matches a particular selector.")

* [Task Scheduler API Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/task-scheduler "This specification defines an API to schedule a task at a specified time. When the indicated time is reached, the application that scheduled the task will be notified via a functional event on a service worker. A task event will be delivered to a service worker, regardless of whether the application is active on user agent. Applications such as an alarm clock or an auto-updater may utilize this API to perform certain action at a specified time.")
* [The app: URI scheme](http://www.w3.org/TR/app-uri "This specification defines the app: URI scheme and rules for dereferencing an app: URI, which can be used to address resources inside a package (e.g., a packaged application). The dereferencing model relies on HTTP semantics to return resources in a manner akin to a HTTP GET request. Doing so allows this URI scheme to be used with other technologies that rely on HTTP responses to function as intended, such as XmlHttpRequest.")

This specification also defines an application programming interface for interacting with this model and it is expected that further specifications will define declarative means for exposing these features.")
* [Web Audio API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio "This specification describes a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The primary paradigm is of an audio routing graph, where a number of AudioNode objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering. The actual processing will primarily take place in the underlying implementation (typically optimized Assembly/C/C++ code), but direct JavaScript processing and synthesis is also supported. This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements on the web platform, notably: XMLHttpRequest (using the responseType and response attributes). For games and interactive applications, it is anticipated to be used with the canvas 2D and WebGL 3D graphics APIs.")
* [Web MIDI API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi " Some user agents have connected music devices, such as synthesizers, keyboard and other controllers, and drum machines. The widely adopted Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) protocol enables electronic musical instruments, controllers and computers to communicate and synchronize with each other. MIDI does not transmit audio signals: instead, it sends event messages about musical notes, controller signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato and panning, cues and clock signals to set the tempo, and system-specific MIDI communications (e.g. to remotely store synthesizer-specific patch data). This same protocol has become a standard for non-musical uses, such as show control, lighting and special effects control. This specification defines an API supporting the MIDI protocol, enabling web applications to enumerate and select MIDI input and output devices on the client system and send and receive MIDI messages. It is intended to enable non-music MIDI applications as well as music ones, by providing low-level access to the MIDI devices available on the users' systems. At the same time, the Web MIDI API is not intended to become a semantic controller platform; it is designed to expose the mechanics of MIDI input and output interfaces, and the practical aspects of sending and receiving MIDI messages, without identifying what those actions might mean semantically. To some users, ”MIDI” has become synonymous with Standard MIDI Files and General MIDI. That is not the intent of this API; the use case of simply playing back a .SMF file is not within the purview of this specification (it could be considered a different format to be supported by the HTML5 <audio> element, for example). The Web MIDI API is intended to enable direct access to devices that respond to MIDI - external synthesizers or lighting systems, for example, or even the software synthesizers that are built in to many common operating systems. The Web MIDI API is also explicitly designed to enable a new class of applications on the web that can respond to MIDI controller inputs - using external hardware controllers with physical buttons, knobs and sliders (as well as musical controllers like keyboard, guitar or wind instrument controllers) to control web applications. The Web MIDI API is also expected to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements of the web platform, notably the Web Audio API and High-Resolution Time. This API is also intended to be familiar to users of MIDI APIs on other systems, such as Apple's CoreMIDI and Microsoft's Windows MIDI API.")
* [Web NFC API](http://www.w3.org/TR/nfc "Near Field Communication (NFC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 18092) that specifies an interface and protocol for simple wireless interconnection of closely coupled devices operating at 13.56 MHz. There are three groups of application scenarios for NFC: The first one is to hold a device close to a wireless tag to exchange some digital information or data; The second is to hold two devices close to each other in order to exchange some information or data between them; The third one is to make payments by holding mobile phones close to point of sales terminals instead of swiping smart cards. NFC enables wireless communication between two devices at close proximity, usually less than a few centimeters.")
* [Web Notifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications "This document defines an API for displaying simple notifications to the user.")
* [Web Telephony API](http://www.w3.org/TR/telephony "This specification defines an API to manage telephone calls. A typical use case of the Web Telephony API is the implementation of a 'Dialer' application supporting multiparty calls and multiple telephony services. A minimal structure for call history items is also defined.")
* [WebCrypto Key Discovery](http://www.w3.org/TR/webcrypto-key-discovery "This specification describes a JavaScript API for discovering named, origin-specific pre-provisioned cryptographic keys for use with the Web Cryptography API. Pre-provisioned keys are keys which have been made available to the UA by means other than the generation, derivation, imporation functions of the Web Cryptography API. Origin-specific keys are keys that are available only to a specified origin. Named keys are identified by a name assumed to be known to the origin in question and provisioned with the key itself.")
* [WebDriver](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver "This specification defines the WebDriver API, a platform-and language-neutral interface that allows programs or scripts to introspect into, and control the behaviour of, a web browser. The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests that automate a browser from a separate controlling process, but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a browser. The WebDriver API is defined by a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page, and to control the behaviour of the containing browser. This specification also includes a non-normative reference useful for browser vendors.")
* [WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers](http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc "This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media to be sent over the network to another browser or device implementing the appropriate set of real-time protocols, and media to be received from another browser or device. This specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed by the IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local media devices developed by the Media Capture Task Force.")
* [WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks Format](http://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1 "This specification defines WebVTT, the Web Video Text Tracks format. Its main use is for marking up external text track resources in connection with the HTML <track> element. WebVTT files provide captions or subtitles for video content, and also text video descriptions, chapters for content navigation, and more generally any form of metadata that is time-aligned with audio or video content.")
