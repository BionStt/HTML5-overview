      <td>This specification defines an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested,
         scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly
         authenticating users. Conceptually, one or more public key credentials, each scoped
         to a given WebAuthn Relying Party, are created and stored on an authenticator by the
         user agent in conjunction with the web application. The user agent mediates access
         to public key credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators are responsible
         for ensuring that no operation is performed without user consent. Authenticators provide
         cryptographic proof of their properties to Relying Parties via attestation. This specification
         also describes the functional model for WebAuthn conformant authenticators, including
         their signature and attestation functionality.
