      <td>This specification defines a JSON-based manifest that provides developers with a centralized
         place to put metadata associated with a web application. This includes, but is not
         limited to, the web application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL
         to open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows developers
         to declare a default orientation for their web application, as well as providing the
         ability to set the display mode for the application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally,
         the manifest allows a developer to "scope" a web application to a URL. This restricts
         the URLs to which the application can be navigated and provides a means to "deep link"
         into a web application from other applications. Using this metadata, user agents can
         provide developers with means to create user experiences that are more comparable
         to that of a native application. In addition, this specification defines the manifest
         link type, which provides a declarative means for a document to be associated with
         a manifest.
