      <td>Near Field Communication (NFC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 18092) that specifies
         an interface and protocol for simple wireless interconnection of closely coupled devices
         operating at 13.56 MHz. There are three groups of application scenarios for NFC: The
         first one is to hold a device close to a wireless tag to exchange some digital information
         or data; The second is to hold two devices close to each other in order to exchange
         some information or data between them; The third one is to make payments by holding
         mobile phones close to point of sales terminals instead of swiping smart cards. NFC
         enables wireless communication between two devices at close proximity, usually less
         than a few centimeters.
