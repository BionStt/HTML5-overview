      <td>This note describes a JavaScript API for discovering named, origin-specific pre-provisioned
         cryptographic keys for use with the Web Cryptography API. Pre-provisioned keys are
         keys which have been made available to the UA by means other than the generation,
         derivation, importation and unwrapping functions of the Web Cryptography API. Origin-specific
         keys are keys that are available only to a specified origin. Named keys are identified
         by a name assumed to be known to the origin in question and provisioned with the key
         itself. This note concerns only keys which have all three of these properties.
