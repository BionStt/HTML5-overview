      <td>This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant
         strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more
         credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single
         Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed
         without the user’s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order
         to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic
         proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes
         a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature
         and attestation functionality.
