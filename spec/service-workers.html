      <td>This specification describes a method that enables applications to take advantage
         of persistent background processing, including hooks to enable bootstrapping of web
         applications while offline. The core of this system is an event-driven Web Worker,
         which responds to events dispatched from documents and other sources. A system for
         managing installation, versions, and upgrades is provided. The Service Worker is a
         generic entry point for event-driven background processing in the Web Platform that
         is extensible by other specifications.
