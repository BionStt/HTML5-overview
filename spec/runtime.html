      <td>This document specifies a runtime and security model for Web Applications. It describes
         how an application is defined through an application manifest, and how it can be installed,
         updated and packaged. It also specifies how such an application can be put into the
         background, be put back in the foreground or woken up. Finally, the document describes
         the security model for such applications. This includes the permission model and the
         different security rules that would apply.
