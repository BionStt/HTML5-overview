| *Canonical URI:* | [`http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents2`](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents2)
| *Abstract:* | The features in this specification extend or modify those found in "Pointer Events", a W3C Recommendation that describes events and related interfaces for handling hardware agnostic pointer input from devices including a mouse, pen, touchscreen, etc. For compatibility with existing mouse based content, this specification also describes a mapping to fire Mouse Events for other pointer device types.
