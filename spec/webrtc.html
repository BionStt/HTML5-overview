      <td>This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media to be sent
         over the network to another browser or device implementing the appropriate set of
         real-time protocols, and media to be received from another browser or device. This
         specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed
         by the IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local media devices
         developed by the Media Capture Task Force.
