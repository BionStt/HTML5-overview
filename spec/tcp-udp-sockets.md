| *Current Status:* | Note (NOTE)
| *Canonical URI:* | [`http://www.w3.org/TR/tcp-udp-sockets`](http://www.w3.org/TR/tcp-udp-sockets)
| *Abstract:* | This API provides interfaces to raw UDP sockets, TCP Client sockets and TCP Server sockets. As such, this requires a high level of trust in applications that use this API, since raw sockets can be used to work around the same origin security policy.
