| *Current Status:* | Working Draft (WD)
| *Canonical URI:* | [`http://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor`](http://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor)
| *Abstract:* | This specification defines a framework for exposing sensor data to the Open Web Platform in a consistent way. It does so by defining a blueprint for writing specifications of concrete sensors along with an abstract Sensor interface that can be extended to accommodate different sensor types.
