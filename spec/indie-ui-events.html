      <td>IndieUI: Events 1.0 is an abstraction between physical, device-specific user interaction
         events and inferred user intent such as scrolling or changing values. This provides
         an intermediate layer between device- and modality-specific user interaction events,
         and the basic user interface functionality used by web applications. IndieUI: Events
         focuses on granular user interface interactions such as scrolling the view, canceling
         an action, changing the value of a user input widget, selecting a range, placing focus
         on an object, etc. Implementing platforms will combine modality-specific user input,
         user idiosyncratic heuristics to determine the specific corresponding Indie UI event,
         and send that to the web application in addition to the modality-specific input such
         as mouse or keyboard events, should applications wish to process it.
