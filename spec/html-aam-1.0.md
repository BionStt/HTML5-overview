| *Abstract:* | HTML Accessibility API Mappings (HTML-AAM) defines how user agents map HTML 5.1 elements and attributes to platform accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs). It leverages and extends the Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 and the Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1 for use with the HTML 5.1 host language. Documenting these mappings promotes interoperable exposure of roles, states, properties, and events implemented by accessibility APIs and helps to ensure that this information appears in a manner consistent with author intent.
