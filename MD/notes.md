* [File API: Directories and System](http://www.w3.org/TR/file-system-api "This specification defines an API to navigate file system hierarchies, and defines a means by which a user agent may expose sandboxed sections of a user's local filesystem to web applications. It builds on File API: Writer, which in turn built on File API, each adding a different kind of functionality.")
* [File API: Writer](http://www.w3.org/TR/file-writer-api "This specification defines an API for writing to files from web applications. This API is designed to be used in conjunction with, and depends on definitions in, other APIs and elements on the web platform. Most relevant among these are File API and Web Workers.")

* [MediaStream Processing API](http://www.w3.org/TR/streamproc "A number of existing or proposed features for the Web platform deal with continuous real-time media: HTML media elements, Synchronization of multiple HTML media elements (e.g. proposed HTML MediaController), Capture and recording of local audio and video input (e.g. proposed HTML Streams), Peer-to-peer streaming of audio and video streams (e.g. proposed WebRTC and HTML Streams), and Advanced audio APIs that allow complex mixing and effects processing (e.g. Mozilla's AudioData, Chrome's AudioNode). Many use-cases require these features to work together. This proposal makes HTML Streams the foundation for integrated Web media processing by creating a mixing and effects processing API for HTML Streams.")
* [Messaging API](http://www.w3.org/TR/messaging "This specification defines a System Level API which offers a simple interface to get access to mobile messaging services.

* [Resource Priorities](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-priorities "This specification defines a means for site developers to programmatically give the User Agent hints on the download priority of a resource. This will allow User Agents to more efficiently manage the order in which resources are downloaded.")
* [Runtime and Security Model for Web Applications](http://www.w3.org/TR/runtime "This document specifies a runtime and security model for Web Applications. It describes how an application is defined through an application manifest, and how it can be installed, updated and packaged. It also specifies how such an application can be put into the background, be put back in the foreground or woken up. Finally, the document describes the security model for such applications. This includes the permission model and the different security rules that would apply.")
* [Selectors API Level 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api2 "The Selectors API specification defines methods for retrieving element nodes from the DOM by matching against a group of selectors, and for testing if a given element matches a particular selector.")
* [System Information API](http://www.w3.org/TR/system-info-api "This specification defines an API to provide Web applications with access to various properties of the system which they are running on. Specifically, properties pertaining to the device hardware are addressed. Examples include battery status, current network bandwidth. Additionally, some of those properties offer access to the environment around the device, such as ambient brightness or atmospheric pressure.")
* [TCP and UDP Socket API](http://www.w3.org/TR/tcp-udp-sockets "This API provides interfaces to raw UDP sockets, TCP Client sockets and TCP Server sockets. As such, this requires a high level of trust in applications that use this API, since raw sockets can be used to work around the same origin security policy.")
* [Task Scheduler API Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/task-scheduler "This specification defines an API to schedule a task at a specified time. When the indicated time is reached, the application that scheduled the task will be notified via a functional event on a service worker. A task event will be delivered to a service worker, regardless of whether the application is active on user agent. Applications such as an alarm clock or an auto-updater may utilize this API to perform certain action at a specified time.")
* [The Messaging API](http://www.w3.org/TR/messaging-api "This specification defines an API that provides access to messaging functionality in the device, including SMS, MMS and email.")
* [The app: URL scheme](http://www.w3.org/TR/app-uri "This specification defines the app: URL scheme. The app: URL scheme can be used by packaged applications to obtain resources that are inside a container. These resources can then be used with web platform features that accept URLs.")
* [The picture Element](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-picture-element "This specification defines the HTML picture element and extends the img and source elements to allow authors to declaratively control or give hints to the user agent about which image resource to use, based on the screen pixel density, viewport size, image format, and other factors.")
* [The srcset Attribute](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-srcset "When authors adapt their sites for high-resolution displays, they often need to be able to use different assets representing the same image.

* [Touch Events Extensions](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events-extensions "This document defines extensions to the Touch Events specification that have been implemented by one or more browsers. We recommend that user agents implement the Touch Events Recommendation and/or the newer Pointer Events specification instead. This document is no longer being developed.")
* [Web Intents](http://www.w3.org/TR/web-intents "This specification defines a service discovery and light-weight RPC mechanism for web apps called Web Intents. This document defines DOM interfaces and markup used by client and service pages to create, receive, and reply to Web Intents messages, and the procedures the User Agent carries out to facilitate that process.")
* [Web Intents Addendum â€” Local Services](http://www.w3.org/TR/webintents-local-services "This specification is an addendum to Web Intents, that defines how Web Intents enabled User Agents can discover and communicate with local Web Intents Services.")
* [Web NFC API](http://www.w3.org/TR/nfc "Near Field Communication (NFC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 18092) that specifies an interface and protocol for simple wireless interconnection of closely coupled devices operating at 13.56 MHz. There are three groups of application scenarios for NFC: The first one is to hold a device close to a wireless tag to exchange some digital information or data; The second is to hold two devices close to each other in order to exchange some information or data between them; The third one is to make payments by holding mobile phones close to point of sales terminals instead of swiping smart cards. NFC enables wireless communication between two devices at close proximity, usually less than a few centimeters.")
* [Web SQL Database](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase "This specification defines an API for storing data in databases that can be queried using a variant of SQL.")
* [Web Telephony API](http://www.w3.org/TR/telephony "This specification defines an API to manage telephone calls.

A minimal structure for call history items is also defined.")
* [XMLHttpRequest Level 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2 "The XMLHttpRequest Level 2 specification enhances the XMLHttpRequest object with new features, such as cross-origin requests, progress events, and the handling of byte streams for both sending and receiving.")
